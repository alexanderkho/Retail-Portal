# About This Application
This is the product-landing page for a retail website. The application is composed of three distinct modules--Product Description, Questions & Answers, and Reviews. I personally built the Q&A module, and collaborated with my teammates via a git-based workflow. 

This project was built with React.js, jQuery, Bootstrap, CSS, SASS and HTML. Among the most challenging and rewarding features I built for the Q&A module are the infinite scroll bar to fetch new questions from the API, and the keyword search feature which does text-highlighting on matching results.  

This application was deployed to an AWS EC2 and can be viewed [here](http://18.188.132.96:7000/).

Alternatively the application can be run locally via the following commands:
```
npm install
npm run react-dev
npm start
```
This will launch the server on localhost:7000.

I also built the back-end API for the Reviews microservice.
